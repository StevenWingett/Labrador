=========================
  TO DO - Labrador v0.2
=========================

--------------
 Essential
--------------

* PHP mail() check
	* Make sure that mail() is working. Give a warning and link to docs if not.

* Custom accession numbers
	* Field for a custom accession
	* config.php set up for custom clickable URLs

* Update checks
	* Have a text file with the latest release version number on our servers
	* If logged in as admin, check database for last version check
	* If out of date, display an admin-only banner saying an update is available
	* Use the version text file to record stats about active users

* Search or filter by group

--------------
 Desirable
--------------

* Admin pages for customisation
	* Move customisation out of config.php into database
	* Have admin only web pages to configure
	
* Extra checks when adding SRA records
	* Make sure that SRR runs are good - check XML attributes
	
* Tidy Up Processing
	* Delete individual steps rather than just the final one
	* Buttons to move steps up and down in order

* Make sure that form inputs aren't being lost when we have errors

* Automated backups
	* Cron job to back up database to file.
	* Automated clean ups of old backups?
	* Accompanying documentation

* Multiple contacts for administrators

* Look up missing data in Datasets edit page from existing accessions..

	* Project Details
	* Datasets - Add
	* Datasets - Edit

* Better form validation - AJAX.
