   TO DO - Labrador
=====================

0 Figure out why require('../') doesn't work
0 Do the database schema properly
0 Do the apache config properly
0 Add search to the project SRA

1 Allow projects to have multiple contacts
	* Remove project contact details, just have user / project lookup table
	* Same for administrators?

2 Consolodate project accession numbers
	* If SRA, DDJB accessions are treated the same, have one box.

1.2 Tidy Dataset naming
	* Automatically trim off GSE number if present
	* Automatically pull in project SRP number if found

1.3 Extra checks when adding SRA records
	* Make sure that SRR runs are good - check XML attributes
	
2. Tidy Up Processing
	* Delete individual steps rather than just the final one
	* Buttons to move steps up and down in order

3. Make sure that form inputs aren't being lost when we have errors

4. Look up missing data in Datasets edit page from existing accessions..
	* Have a tick box to allow overwriting?
	* Use a big button next to save and delete?

5. Check for empty fields, suggest (but don't force) completion on form submit
	* Project Details
	* Datasets - Add
	* Datasets - Edit

6. Better form validation - AJAX. 
	* Check formats of accession codes
	* Search for duplicates when entering accessions and project names

8. Automated backups
	* Cron job to back up database to file.
	* SVN ignore .sql files
	* Automated clean ups of old backups?

9. Tidy Up!
	* Go through and delete all of the files that are not being used
	* Read through code and see what can be tidied up

10. Look into different user authentication systems
	* Exchange ActiveServer thingy?
	* New computing authentication solution?
