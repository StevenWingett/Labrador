----------
Essential
----------

* Do the database schema properly

* Do the apache config properly

* Allow projects to have multiple contacts
	* Remove project contact details, just have user / project lookup table
	* Same for administrators?
	
* Tidy Dataset naming
	* Automatically trim off GSE number if present


----------
Desirable
----------

* Figure out why require('../') doesn't work

* Consolodate project accession numbers
	* If SRA, DDJB accessions are treated the same, have one box.

* Automatically pull in project SRP number if found

* Tidy Up!
	* Go through and delete all of the files that are not being used
	* Read through code and see what can be tidied up

Would be nice
--------------

* Extra checks when adding SRA records
	* Make sure that SRR runs are good - check XML attributes
	
* Tidy Up Processing
	* Delete individual steps rather than just the final one
	* Buttons to move steps up and down in order

* Make sure that form inputs aren't being lost when we have errors

* Look up missing data in Datasets edit page from existing accessions..
	* Have a tick box to allow overwriting?
	* Use a big button next to save and delete?

* Check for empty fields, suggest (but don't force) completion on form submit
	* Project Details
	* Datasets - Add
	* Datasets - Edit

* Better form validation - AJAX. 
	* Check formats of accession codes
	* Search for duplicates when entering accessions and project names

* Automated backups
	* Cron job to back up database to file.
	* SVN ignore .sql files
	* Automated clean ups of old backups?

* Look into different user authentication systems
	* Exchange ActiveServer thingy?
	* New computing authentication solution?
